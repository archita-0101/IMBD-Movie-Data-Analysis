Welcome to my Google Colab notebook for the IMDB Movie Data Analysis Minor Project.
This notebook is an enhanced version of the base project provided, where I’ve added multiple new insights and visualizations using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
It explores the IMDB dataset to uncover trends in movie ratings, genres, revenues, directors, and more — giving hands-on experience with real-world data analysis.

Run the cells below to explore the analysis, view the visual outputs, and see how Python can turn raw data into insights!
